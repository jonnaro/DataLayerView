# DataLayerView
A Chrome extension to view the contents of a w3c-compliant data layer object

## Disclaimer
This is currently a very basic extension and was meant to be more of a proof-of-concept. It will be built out over time to be more flexible.

## Assumptions
* The data layer object is ```window.digitalData```
